Pseudo Code for Image to 3D Model Converter
===========================================

1. Initialize Program
   - Set up logging mechanism.
   - Initialize default parameters (detail = 'high', color mode = 'image').

2. Parse Command-Line Arguments
   - Extract input and output file paths.
   - Override default parameters with user-specified values if provided.

3. Open Log File
   - Create and open a log file to record diagnostic information.

4. Load Input Image
   - Attempt to load the image from the input file path.
   - Log success or failure.
   - Validate image format and content (black background).
   - Log validation results.

5. Color Mapping (if color mode is 'image')
   - For each pixel in the image:
     - Find the closest match in the ASCII color set, considering color and brightness.
     - Log the mapping results for each significant section of the image.

6. Depth Approximation
   - Analyze the image to approximate depth based on contextual clues.
   - Log the depth analysis process and results.

7. 3D Model Generation
   - Based on depth information, create vertices and edges for the 3D model.
   - Apply color mapping to the model.
   - Log the model generation process.

8. glTF File Creation
   - Convert the 3D model into glTF format.
   - Save the glTF file to the output file path.
   - Log the file creation process and any issues encountered.

9. Error Handling
   - Handle errors at each step, log the errors, and provide user feedback if necessary.

10. Finalize Output
    - Confirm creation of the .gltf file.
    - Close the log file.
    - Provide a final diagnostic summary in the log file.
    - Display a completion message to the user with the output file and log file locations.

11. Terminate Program
    - Clean up resources.
    - Exit the program.
